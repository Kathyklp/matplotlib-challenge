I’m sorry there are so many files. I am having trouble with Github.
Please use the following files that are the most up-to-date:

I am submitting this again to make sure that I included the correct html link. I was not able to use the website url submission.

I received this from Cortney Totty: “In order for an assignment to count towards gradution, it requires any score above 0. Regarding the rubric and challenge grade you are correct. Your score is is based on the rubric.” I am sure I have completed enough to get the one point required to get credit for the assignment. 

I will complete the assignments later, on my own. I need to ensure that I have one point on each assignment to graduate. Based on the rubric I completed the following:
Requirements
* Prepare the Data (20 points)
•	The datasets are merged into a single DataFrame. (6 points)   completed
•	The number of mice are shown from the merged DataFrame. (2 points)  completed
•	Each duplicate mice is found based on the Mouse ID and Timepoint. (6 points)  completed
•	A clean DataFrame is created with the dropped duplicate mice. (4 points)   
•	The number of mice are shown from the clean DataFrame. (2 points)
Thank you for your time. Kathy
